===============================

This recipe is adapted from [The Big Sur Bakery Cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061441481?ie=UTF8&tag=smitten-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0061441481) and shared by [Smittenkitchen Breakfast Pizza](https://smittenkitchen.com/2010/03/breakfast-pizza/)

*A cheesy pizza with backed bacon/egg/melted pile to bump up your energy of a day, with herbs and mild onions on top to balance the heavy texture and refresh your mind. As a breakfast, it has kind of grab-and-go that perfect for weather that demands you don’t idle long inside.*

Prepare your ingredients
------------------------

(This recipe can meke 2 (12-inch) pizzas) 

-   For dough:
    -   1/2 teaspoon dry active yeast
    -   2 cups plus 2 tablespoons bread flour, plus more for dusting Kosher salt.
-   For Topping:
    -   6 strips bacon
    -   1/2 cup grated Parmesan
    -   2 cups grated mozzarella
    -   6 large eggs
    -   Freshly ground black pepper
    -   2 tablespoons minced flat-leaf parsley
    -   2 tablespoons minced chives
    -   2 scallions, thinly sliced
    -   1 shallot, minced
-   Special cooking tool you may need:
    -   An electric mixer

Cooking instruction
-------------------

1.  **The night before, prepare your dough: **
    1.  Place 3/4 cup lukewarm water in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook.
    2.  Sprinkle in the yeast, stir and let sit for 5 minutes.
    3.  Add the flour and 1 teaspoon of salt and mix on low for 1 minute.
    4.  Increase the speed to medium and mix for 2 minutes, then increase the speed to high and mix until a smooth dough forms, about 2 minutes more.
    5.  Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface, divide into two equal pieces and form each half into a tight ball. 6. Place on a large floured sheet pan, place the pan in a plastic garbage bag, tie the bag loosely and refrigerate overnight.
2.  **One to two hours before baking, prepare your topping and dough:**
    1.  Fry the bacon in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat until crisp.
    2.  Cool on a paper-towel-lined plate; roughly chop.
    3.  place the dough in a warm spot.
    4.  Dip your hands and a ball of dough into the flour.
    5.  On a lightly floured countertop, pat the dough into a disc with your fingertips, then drape the dough over your fists and carefully stretch it from beneath to form a 12-inch circle.
    6.  Generously dust the surface of a pizza peel or large inverted sheet pan with flour and place the stretched dough on it.
    7.  Sprinkle the dough with half of the Parmesan, mozzarella and bacon.
    8.  Crack 3 eggs over the top and season with salt and pepper.
    9.  Adjust the oven rack to the lowest position and set a pizza stone on it. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees 30 minutes before you are ready to bake the pizza.
3.  **Bake the pizza: **
    1.  Shake the pizza peel slightly to make sure the dough is not sticking.
    2.  Carefully lift any sections that are sticking and sprinkle a bit more flour underneath, then slide the pizza directly onto the baking stone in one quick forward-and-back motion.
    3.  Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, rotating after 5 minutes. When the crust is golden, the cheese is melted and the egg yolks are cooked, use the peel to transfer the pizza to a cutting board.
    4.  Sprinkle half of the parsley, chives, scallions and shallot on top. Let cool for 2 minutes, slice and serve immediately. Prepare the second pizza in the same way.

Other options to make your own pizza:
-------------------------------------

-   The bacon could of course be omitted if you’re bacon-averse, countless toppings could be added from spinach to mushrooms or sausage.
-   You could swap some or all of the mozzarella for goat cheese.
-   You could swap out some of the flour in the crust for whole wheat flour.
-   Although the recipe as is makes two large pizzas, I think it would be fun to make six smaller ones with one egg each in the center.

Euclidean Distance
==================

### Definition

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them $\\overline{pq}$.

In [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system), if **p** = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q** = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean *n*-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the [Pythagorean formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem):

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a [Euclidean vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector). So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The [Euclidean norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Euclidean_norm), or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:
$$
\\left\\Vert{p}\\right\\Vert = \\sqrt{(p\_1)^2 + (p\_2)^2 + \\dots + (p\_n)^2} = \\sqrt{{p} \\cdot {p}},
$$
 where the last expression involves the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product).
